# Introduction

Study Corpus linguistics of English grammar

## Literature review

Most previous literature on the corpus study of English grammar is for educational purposes. Numerous contemporary theories of language comprehension emphasize the significance of distributional frequencies in determining the relative accessibility or processing ease linked to specific lexical items or sentence structures. Despite this emphasis, there is a scarcity of comprehensive analyses on structural frequencies, and minimal attention has been devoted to assessing the suitability of employing any specific corpus frequencies for modeling human language.The current research question is to discover the significant characteristics of English grammar.

# Methods

1. Data Acquisition:\
The study utilizes diverse English texts from reputable linguistic databases like the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA).

Data Organization:
Texts are segmented into sentences and tokenized for linguistic unit extraction. The dataset is then formatted for structured computational analysis.

Data Enrichment:
Linguistic annotations and metadata such as part-of-speech tags and syntactic parse trees are added to enhance the corpus, enabling nuanced insights.

Feature Selection and Engineering:
Various linguistic features like word frequencies, collocational patterns, and syntactic constructions are chosen for analysis. Feature engineering may be used to derive novel linguistic attributes.

Analysis Techniques:
Quantitative and computational linguistics methods including frequency analysis, distributional analysis, and machine learning models are employed to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Evaluation Process:
Exploratory data analysis, inter-annotator agreement measures, and cross-validation techniques ensure the validity and reliability of the findings across different linguistic contexts.


## Data preparation

The data for this study originates from diverse English texts sourced from reputable linguistic databases such as the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). Collection involves systematic retrieval based on predefined criteria followed by thorough cleaning to eliminate noise and inconsistencies. Additionally, the dataset is enriched through linguistic annotations including part-of-speech tags and syntactic structures. Normalization techniques ensure consistency, while sampling and partitioning may be employed for manageability. This rigorous process aims to establish a high-quality dataset, facilitating the subsequent analysis of English grammar characteristics with reliability and depth.

## Data analysis

In analyzing English grammar characteristics, the study employs a careful selection of linguistic features, including word frequencies, collocational patterns, and syntactic structures, further refined through feature engineering techniques. Quantitative and computational linguistics methods such as frequency and distributional analysis, alongside machine learning models and natural language processing algorithms, unveil nuanced patterns within the corpus. Rigorous evaluation, encompassing exploratory data analysis, measures of inter-annotator agreement, and cross-validation techniques, ensures the credibility and reliability of the findings across diverse linguistic contexts and datasets, establishing a robust foundation for deriving meaningful insights.

# Expected results

The analysis is expected to reveal prominent structural patterns in English grammar, including collocational patterns and syntactic constructions. These findings may elucidate language comprehension mechanisms and processing ease. Moreover, insights from corpus-based frequencies could refine linguistic theories, inform pedagogy, and advance computational language modeling, impacting Linguistics and language science.

# Communication plan

The study's findings will be disseminated through multiple channels to maximize impact. The primary audience includes researchers and scholars in linguistics, corpus linguistics, and language processing. The results will be presented in academic conferences and peer-reviewed journals, ensuring visibility within the scholarly community. Additionally, efforts will be made to share key insights through online platforms, including research blogs and social media, to engage a broader audience interested in language science and computational linguistics. This comprehensive communication plan aims to facilitate knowledge exchange and foster collaboration across disciplinary boundaries.
